# Foodie App

This app was bootstrapped using expo-cli
```
npx expo-cli init appName
```

Yarn is being used for the package manager

Run the App by typing:
```
yarn start
```

Because the app was created using the expo-cli, some useful tools that come ready to use include:
* [vector-icons](https://github.com/expo/vector-icons) - [Here's a shortcut](https://icons.expo.fyi) to quickly view and search for available icons
